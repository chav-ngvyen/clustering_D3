For your final project, you will have the opportunity to draw on all the topics that we have discussed during the course. While not required, this project can draw from or build upon all your previous assignments in this course. As with your other assignments, the topic, data, technologies, visualizations, and methods to use are up to you. However, you must provide a “production” version of your final project with documentation that:

    Must be web accessible
    Must include at least two dynamic visualizations (but please use as many static or dynamic visualizations as necessary to drive your point home)
    Must tell a “story” around the data. Instead of just creating a dynamic dashboard, provide qualitative or quantitative context for those visiting your site
    Should reflect the various design techniques and recommendations discussed in class

Your final submission should consist of a two to five-page final report that contains the following information:

    Executive summary
    A link to your visualization
    A description of the data sources used and, if applicable, the transformations applied
    List/description of the significant technologies/platforms used
    Key highlights/stories your visualization can be used to highlight (talking points)

Your technical documentation that you submit must include:

    The code/notebook used to build the visualization(s)
    Where appropriate, comments describing the steps you have taken to produce the visualization
