# DBSCAN and HDBSCAN interactive tutorial in D3.js

For my Data Visualization final project, I wanted to challenge myself to learn  and implement a new data visualization tool - D3.js. I also wanted to create a "scrollytelling" webpage with self-updating graphics, which required some knowledge on HTML, SVG and JavaScript. <br><br> 

To tie this interactive scrollyboard into broader Data Science themes, I created a lighthearted tutorial to show the differences between 2 clustering algorithms - DBSCAN and HDBSCAN. <br><br> 

Clicky [here](https://chav-ngvyen.github.io/clustering_d3/) to get to the interactive page. Below is a sped-up gif of what you can expect to see as you scroll down the page.
