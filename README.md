# DBSCAN and HDBSCAN interactive tutorial in D3.js

In this Data Visualization for Data Science final project, I challenged myself to:

* Learn and implement a new data visualization tool - D3.js.
* Create a "scrollytelling" webpage with self-updating graphics, which required some knowledge on HTML, SVG and JavaScript. <br> 

To tie the interactive webpage into broader Data Science themes, I created a lighthearted tutorial to show the differences between 2 clustering algorithms - DBSCAN and HDBSCAN. <br>

Please click [here](https://chav-ngvyen.github.io/clustering_D3/) to get to the interactive page. Below is a sped-up gif of what you can expect to see as you scroll down the page.
