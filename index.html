            <h2>Hello and welcome!</h2> <br>
            <p> 
            Thank you for checking out my project! <br><br><br>

            I will give an overview of 2 density-based clustering algorithms: <strong>DBSCAN</strong> and <strong>HDBSCAN</strong>.<br><br><br>

            Through this <i>scrollybroad</i>, you will find demonstrations of how the algorithms work through self-updating visuals.<br><br><br>

            This is a scrolling page, so please <strong>scroll</strong> along!

            <h2>Unlabeled data</h2> <br>
            <p>
            Imagine you have a <strong>set of objects</strong> you would like to study    <br> <br>        
            (or if you prefer to not use your imagination, they'd still appear in the corner of your eyes soon enough)

            <br><br><br>


            You want to put these data points into <strong>groups </strong> before you can effectively study each group.
            <br><br><br>

            However, you don't know <strong>what</strong> the groups are
            <br><br><br>

            <strong>How many</strong> categories you can put your objects in
            <br><br><br>
            
            And you also <strong>cannot</strong> look at the items <strong>individually</strong> to characterize them.

            <h2>Unsupervised machine learning</h2> <br>

            <p>
            Clustering is a subset of <strong>unsupervised</strong> ML algorithms developed to solve your very problem! <br><br><br>

            Clustering analysis can be thought of as <strong>classification</strong> techniques.<br><br><br>
            
            Because the labels are <strong>derived</strong> from the data itself, it is <strong> unsupervised </strong>, meaning there are no outcomes (labels) to compared the clusters to. <br><br><br>

            <strong>Popular</strong> clustering algorithms include: <br><br>

            1) K-means: <strong>Prototype-based</strong> clustering techniques create a one-level partitioning of the data objects. <br><br>

            2) <strong>Hierarchical</strong> clustering. <br><br>

            3) <strong>Density-based</strong> clustering, which is the focus of this tutorial.

            <h2>Density-based clustering </h2> <br><br>

            <p>
              By now, the <strong>unlabeled points</strong> on the left side of the page should have finished rendering <br><br><br>
              Let's take a look at them!<br><br><br>
              What do you know about them? <br> Close to <strong style="color: white">nothing</strong>, right?<br><br><br>
              If I gave you a <strong style="color: yellow">box</strong> <strong style="color: red;"> of </strong> <strong style="color: blue;"> crayons </strong> and ask you to color the <strong>clusters of points</strong>
              , would you be able to? <br> 
              <strong style="color: white"> Probably! </strong><br><br>
              Before discussing these synthetic clusters, let's briefly talk about one of the pioneers of density-based clustering algorithms: <strong style="color: white;"> DBSCAN. </strong>

          <h2>Introducing <strong> DBSCAN</strong> </h2> <br>
          <p> <strong>D</strong>ensity-<strong>b</strong>ased <strong>s</strong>patial <strong>c</strong>lustering of <strong>a</strong>pplications with <strong>n</strong>oise <br><br>
            Identifies clusters by locating points in regions of high density that can be separated from another point in regions of lower density.<br><br><br>

            <strong>How</strong>: <br><br>

            1) Finds <strong>core points</strong> - objects with more than minimum number of neighbors within a certain radius.<br><br>
        
            2) Finds areas around the core point that satisfy minimum density calculated from radius and number of neighbors earlier. <br><br>

            Two main <strong> tuning parameters </strong>: <br><br>

            1) epsilon (radius) of a point in relation to another point to be considered as points in the same neighborhood. <strong> NOT </strong> the maximum bound on distances of points within a cluster. <br><br>
            
            2) min_samples: number of neighbors in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point. This includes the point itself. <br><br>

              <h2> Synthetic data </h2>
            <p>
              In this first example, we will examine <strong>2123 </strong>synthetic data points I generated using sklearn's built-in make_blobs function. <br><br><br>
              
              Unlike real world datasets where the outcome clusters are truly unlabeled (one of which you will interact with as you scroll down) <br><br><br>
            
              Because I created these datapoints, I know exactly <strong> how many cluster labels </strong> there are. <br><br><br>

             <strong> 20. </strong><div class=""></div>

          </div>

          <div id = "div7">
            <h2><strong>20 clusters </strong> huh &#129300; </h2>
            <p>
              There are <strong>20</strong> distinct clusters on screen. What was your guess before? Not quite 20, was it? <br><br><br>
              
              On the left of the canvas, there is a cluster of blue and red point that sklearn assigned 2 different labels. <br><br>

              We can identify a similar green-yellow blob on the right as well. <br><br>
            
              When creating the data, I only wanted 2 features for each datapoint so they would map out nicely on an XY plane (more on that later). <br><br>
              
              
              One last thing to note is that I based the X & Y scale from GPS coordinates. <br><br><br>

        
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id = "div8">
            <h2>DBSCAN</h2>
            <p>
              Next, let's see how DBSCAN does with this synthetic dataset. <br><br>

              For this first simulation, I did an <strong "style=color:white;">eye test</strong> for each distinct blob of points I could identify. <br><br>
              
              I require the radius of a core point to be <strong>0.5</strong>(km). <br><br>
              
              And core points must have at least <strong>10 neighbors</strong> within the 0.5km radius. <br><br>
              
              The updated colors show that DBSCAN picked up <strong>17 clusters</strong> using these parameters. <br><br>

              It found <strong>9</strong> points that couldn't be assigned a cluster number and marke them as noise. <br><br>

              The main 17 clusters DBSCAN identified were inline with what I would have color the blobs had I had a <strong style="color: yellow">box</strong> <strong style="color: red;"> of </strong> <strong style="color: blue;"> crayons </strong>.
              
            </p>
              
          </div>

          <div id = "div9">
            <h2>DBSCAN... <strong> eyetest?</strong></h2>

            <p>
            I hope you didn't immediately close this tab when I said "eyetest". <br><br>

             Why would I want to do an eye test on <strong>fake</strong> unlabeled data (not really unlabeled) to give the 
             model the parameters that would probably allow it to return the <strong>results I wanted?</strong> <br><br>

             Wouldn't that defeat the whole point of applying <strong>unsupervised learning algorithms</strong> on <strong>unlabeled data</strong> 
            to let the model to tell us correlations in the data that <strong>can't see</strong> with our own eyes? <br><br>

            Yes, yes, and also yes. <br><br>

            That's the point. Even though the synthethic data is practically unlabeled, I still have <i> domain expertise </i> over them (because I did spend a shameful amount of time playing with random seed and cluster standard devation to make the blobs obvious and confusing enough)<br><br>
            
            Now that we know DBSCAN can cluster blobs of points as well as an eyetest, let's throw more things at it!

          </div>

          <div id = "div10">
            <h2>DBSCAN part 2</h2>

            <p>
              In the second simulation, I set more a <strong>liberal</strong> set of parameters: for a point to be a core point to start defining its neighborhood (clsuter), it only needs to have <strong>5 neighbors</strong> within a <strong>0.2km</strong> radius.<br><br>
              
              With the updated requirements, DBSCAN found 29 clusters, but also classify a lot more points as noise. The fewer number of neighbors and smaller radius requirements helped small inner clusters as <i> legitimate </i> clusters and disqualify many points outside on the edge of each blob. <br><br>

              &#129300; <br><br>

              &#129300; <br><br>

              So I'm saying that setting a more liberal parameter to cluster the blobs would give
